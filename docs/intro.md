Welcome!👋 This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains — including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 — using modern documentation workflows and tools. This portfolio highlights the practical skills I’ve built during the WriteTech Accelerator.
