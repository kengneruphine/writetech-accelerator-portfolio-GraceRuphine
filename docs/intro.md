# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

 Welcome!👋 This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains — including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 — using modern documentation workflows and tools.


## 👩‍💻 About Me
I am a Software Engineer (Backend-Heavy) and DevOps Enthusiast with experience building applications using Node.js, Express.js, Java, and Spring/Spring Boot. As a lifelong learner, I am eager to add technical writing to my skill set and begin creating user-friendly, well-detailed documentations. This portfolio highlights the practical skills I’ve built during the WriteTech Accelerator.
