# API Documentation Project

This project documents [Chimoney](chimoney.io) Public REST API, including a Getting started section and selected endpoints following the OpenAPI Specifications.

In this project, I documented the beneficiaries endpoints following the OpenAPI specification.

[This Plugin](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) was used to render OpenAPI in Docusaurus.

## What I Learnt

- I learned how to configured and add OpenAPI specification to docusaurus and documented the beneficiaries endpoints from the Chimoney REST API
