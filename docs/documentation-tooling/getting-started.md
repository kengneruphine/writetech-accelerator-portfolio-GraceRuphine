## Quickstart

In this tutorial, you will discover Microcks mocking features by using a simple REST API sample. You will run Microcks on your local machine, load a sample provided by the Microcks team, explore the web user interface and interact with an API mock.

The easiest way to get started with Microcks is by using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) with our ephemeral all-in-one Microcks distribution.

In your terminal, issue the following commandâ€”optionally replacing <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>8585</span> with another port of your choice if this one is not available:

```json
docker run -p 8585:8080 -it --rm quay.io/microcks/microcks-uber:latest-native 
```

This will pull and start the <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>Uber</span> container and set up a simple environment for you to use. You should see something like this in your terminal:

```json
 .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \

  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /

Open a new browser tab and navigate to the *`http://localhost:8585`* endpointâ€”or another port of your choice to access Microcks.

## Using Microcks

Now you are ready to use Microcks for deploying your own services and API mocks! But first, letâ€™s take a look at the application home screen and introduce the main concepts. Using the application URL after installation, you should land on this page, which has two main entry points: **APIs | Services** and **Importers**.

<img src="/img/microcks/getting-1.png" alt="home screen" />

As you may have guessed :

- **APIs | Services** is for browsing your services and API repository, discovering and accessing documentation, mocks, and tests.
- **Importers** help you populate your repository by allowing you to define jobs that periodically scan your Git or simple HTTP repositories for new artifacts, parse them, and integrate them into your services and API repository. In fact, Importers help you discover both new and modified services.

Before using your own service definition files, letâ€™s load some samples into Microcks for a test run!

### Loading a Sample

We provide various samples that illustrate the capabilities of Microcks across different protocols. Samples can be loaded via **Importers**, as mentioned above, or via the [Microcks Hub](https://hub.microcks.io/) entry in the vertical menu on the left.

<img src="/img/microcks/getting-2.png" alt="load samples" />

Among the tiles on this screen, choose the <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>MicrocksIO Samples API</span> tile, which will give you access to the list of available samples. To get started with Microcks, we will explore the <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>Pastry API - 2.0</span>, a simple REST API. Select it from the list of available APIs at the bottom right:

<img src="/img/microcks/getting-3.png" alt="microck samples" />

On the following screen, click the large blue Install button, where you will choose the <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>+ Direct import method</span>.

### Viewing an API

Once the import is complete, a new API will have been discovered and added to your repository. You should see the result below, along with two notification toasts in the top right corner.

<img src="/img/microcks/getting-4.png" alt="view api" />

You can then click the green <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>âœ“ Go</span> buttonâ€”or visit the **API | Services** menu entryâ€”to access the <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>Pastry API - 2.0</span> details:

<img src="/img/microcks/getting-5.png" alt="discover api" />

ouâ€™ll be able to access the details, documentation, and request/response samples for each operation or resource in the screen below. One important piece of information is the **Mocks URL** field: this is the endpoint where Microcks automatically deploys a mock for the operation. The table below shows the request/response pairs and the full URL with the HTTP verb for invoking this mock.

<img src="/img/microcks/getting-6.png" alt="mock" />

### Interacting with a Mock

At the end of the **Mock URL** line, youâ€™ll notice two icons. The first allows you to copy the URL to the clipboard, so you can use it directly in a browser, for example. The second provides a <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>curl</span> command to interact with the mocked API from the terminal. You can copy the URL for the <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>Millefeuille</span> example and try it in your terminal:

```json
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8585/rest/API+Pastry+-+2.0/2.0.0/pastry/Millefeuille' -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

```json
{"name":"Millefeuille","description":"Delicieux Millefeuille pas calorique du tout","size":"L","price":4.4,"status":"available"}
```

Ta Dam! ðŸŽ‰

```json
{"name":"Millefeuille","description":"Delicieux Millefeuille pas calorique du tout","size":"L","price":4.4,"status":"available"}
```

## What's next?

Now that you have the basic information on how to set up and use Microcks, you can proceed further with:

- Importing additional samples from <span style={{ color: 'pink' }}>MicrocksIO Samples API</span> in the [Microcks Hub](https://hub.microcks.io/).
- Continuing your tour with Getting started with Tests,
- Writing your own artifacts files and creating:
   - Your first OpenAPI mock
   - Your first GraphQL mock,
   - Your first gRPC mock,
   - Your first AsyncAPI mock with Kafka.
