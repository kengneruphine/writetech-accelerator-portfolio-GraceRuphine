# Documentation Tooling Project (Docusaurus Site)

This project involved auditing and restructuring documentation for [Microcks](https://microcks.io/) using Docusaurus.

## What I Improved

The main improvements made to this documentation were in punctuation, sentence structure, and typos.

- For example, on the Getting Started page, the word ephemeral was misspelled.
Also, on the same page, the phrase:

            "open a new browser tab and point to the http://localhost:8585"

              should be:

            "Open a new browser tab and navigate to http://localhost:8585"
 since we are referring to a URL.

- Additionally, in the Loading a Sample section on the Getting Started page, there were word repetitions, such as:

    "We provide different samples that illustrate the different capabilities"

    Instead, using synonyms avoids repetition:

    "We provide various samples that illustrate the capabilities."

## Challenges

I did not encounter any major challenges while working on this project. The initial challenge was selecting an open-source project to work with.

Another challenge is that, as I am relatively new to technical writing, I may have overlooked issues that someone with more experience in documentation might have noticed. Any guidance or tips on how to improve and move forward would be greatly appreciated.

## What I Learnt

I learned alot during this exercise:

- I enhanced my knowledge of configuring the sidebar. I was able to add a third-level hierarchy to the sidebar, to improve navigation and make it easy to find nested content.
- On the *using-microcks-cli* page, I embedded links to the *connecting-to-microcks-api* and *getting-started* pages, which helped me understand cross-referencing between documentation pages for a smoother user experience.
- I learned how to incorporate HTML elements within Markdown for more flexible formatting.
- I tried using MarkdownLint in VS code for formatting my files for a consistent, clean and readable documentation.
